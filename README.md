## 🚀 Problem Statement
Learning is often boring, passive, and one-size-fits-all. Students struggle to stay engaged with complex concepts.
Current AI tools just answer questions instead of creating an interactive, memorable experience.

## 💡 Our Solution

Cognito makes studying feel like chatting with your favorite historical figure or fictional character. Instead of plain explanations, the AI takes on a persona—Einstein explaining entropy with train analogies, or Iron Man teaching coding with wit and humor.

## ✨ Key Features 

📚 Personalized Tutoring: Upload notes, and the AI uses them as context.

🎭 Character Personas: Learn from Einstein, Iron Man, or anyone else.

💬 Conversational Style: Not just answers—engaging discussions.

⚡ Lightweight Tech Stack: Simple frontend + backend API calls.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.

Backend: Python(Django).

AI: Gemini API (or OpenAI API) Elevenlabs.

## 🔑 How It Works

User selects a persona (Einstein, Iron Man, etc.).

User uploads/pastes notes.

Backend sends the notes + persona system prompt to the LLM.

AI responds in character, explaining and teaching interactively.

## 🎯 Impact
Cognito makes learning more engaging, personal, and memorable. Instead of passive reading, students get a one-of-a-kind experience that sticks.

## 📽️ Demo Idea
Show a user uploading notes.

Ask “Einstein” to explain entropy.

Ask “Iron Man” to explain recursion in coding.

Show the difference in tone and engagement.
